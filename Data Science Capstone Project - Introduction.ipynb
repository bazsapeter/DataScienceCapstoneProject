    "### What is Crossfit?\n",
    "\n",
    "Crossfit is a relatively new fitness direction, basically functional fitness where the goal is to prepare your body for any physical challenge. Originally, it started as a licensed brand, and it started spreading across the world later. It includes nearly every kind of sport, from the olympic wightlifting, through gymnastic skills, running, endurance tests etc. This sport is done in places called Boxes. These are not like regular gyms, they need special floor, special equipment, therefore this functional fitness cannot be done everywhere."

    "\n",
    "Crossfit was established in Hungary in the early 2013 with only a few boxes. There is a difference between the original Crossfit Boxes and the other places, so called Cross-training gyms. The main difference is the name, therefore the brand that it represents. Only those boxes, who bought the license can use the name Crossfit. In this project, I only investigate the licensed boxes, because these are the traditional Crossfit Boxes."

    "The main purpose of this project is to reveal the potential places in Budapest, Hungary where a Crossfit Box can be started. There are many neighborhood with the proper condition for establishing a Crossfit Box, some of them already have one. This investigation will reveal the common attributes between these, and also tries to find other, similar neighborhoods.\n",

    "\n",
    "To reach the goal, first and foremost, I needed a dataset, which contains the Budapest neighborhood coordinations. Thanks to the Geolocator API, there is no need for a dataset which contains them explicitly, I just need the proper names of the neighborhoods. With the following webpage: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_districts_in_Budapest and a little transormation on these is enough to fulfill this requirement. After these coordinations are claimed, the Foursquare API will give the data regarding the user feedback for each neighborhood."
